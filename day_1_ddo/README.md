# CDT Winter School ‚Äì Day 1  

## Overview  
Day 1 will introduce key concepts in **data-driven optimisation**, starting with foundational lectures and hands-on tutorials. The day concludes with a **hackathon**, where participants will implement and test optimization algorithms.  

## Schedule  
1. **Lecture: Introduction to Mathematical Modelling and Parameter Estimation** ‚Äì *Dr. Antonio del Rio Chanona*  
2. **Tutorial: Parameter Estimation Methods**  
   - Notebook: `manual_param_search.ipynb`  
   - Work through the notebook with instructors. 
   - Notebook: `gradient_descent.ipynb`
   - Work through the notebook on your own.
   - Group discussion.
3. **Lecture: Data-Driven Optimisation (DDO) Algorithms** ‚Äì *Dr. Antonio del Rio Chanona*
4. **Hackathon: DDO Algorithms**   

## Hackathon  

The hackathon is designed to apply concepts from the lectures and tutorials to a practical problem.  
- **Tracks and teams have been pre-assigned.** Check the **Teams channel** for your assignment.  
- Instructions can be found in the **hackathon workbook**:  
  üìÑ [`ddo_hackathon/hackathon_workbook.ipynb`](./ddo_hackathon/hackathon_workbook.ipynb)  

### **Tracks**  
- **Track 1: Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO)**  
  - Participants will implement **PSO**, using a **template provided in** [`ddo_hackathon/algorithms/particle_swarm.py`](./ddo_hackathon/algorithms/particle_swarm.py).  
  - üõë **No LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) allowed.**  
- **Track 2: DDO Algorithm of Your Choice**  
  - Participants will develop their own optimisation algorithm.
  - A template for the required signature is provided in [`ddo_hackathon/algorithms/your_alg.py`](./ddo_hackathon/algorithms/your_alg.py).


For **benchmarking**, the **hackathon workbook** provides a working routine and **state-of-the-art algorithms for comparison**.  

**Hackathon Instructors:**  
- *Emma Pajak*  
- *Dr. Laura Helleckes*  
- *Dr. Antonio del Rio Chanona*  

## Submissions  

We have created a **Streamlit app** for submitting results:  
üîó [https://react-ddo-day1.streamlit.app](https://react-ddo-day1.streamlit.app)  

- **Unlimited submissions** are allowed throughout Day 1.  
- To ensure automated benchmarking, follow the formatting instructions in the **hackathon workbook**.  
- The **leaderboard** can be found in the app.  

## Additional Notes  
- üìå **Tracks and teams were pre-assigned**‚Äîcheck the **Teams channel** for details.  
- ‚ùì **Need help?** Instructors are available **during sessions** and can be reached via **Teams**.  
- üí° **Participation is key‚Äîmake the most of it!**
