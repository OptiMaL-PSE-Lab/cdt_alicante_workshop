# CDT Winter School – Day 2  

## Overview  
Day 2 focuses on **model discrimination and parameter estimation**, where participants will analyse an **unknown model** using provided data. The goal is to identify the **best model and parameters** from a set of candidate models.  

## Schedule  
1. **Lecture: Automating Model Construction** – *Dr. Antonio del Rio Chanona*
2. **Optional Tutorial: Understanding Candidate Terms for the Bio Model**  
   - Notebook: `bio_model.ipynb`  
   - This tutorial is available for participants to work through at their own pace.  
3. **Hackathon: Model Discrimination and Parameter Estimation**  

## Hackathon  

The hackathon challenges participants to **identify the correct model structure and parameters** using provided data.  
- Instructions can be found in the **hackathon workbook**:  
  📄 [`md_hackathon/md_hackathon.ipynb`](./md_hackathon/md_hackathon.ipynb)  

### **Tracks**  
- **Track 1: Local Random Search**
  - Participants will implement a **Local Random Search**, using a **template provided in the hackathon workbook**.  
  - 🛑 **No LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) allowed.**  
- **Track 2: Genetic Algorithm**
  - Participants will develop a genetic algorithm.
  - The signature and criteria for the benchmarking are explained in the hackathon notebook.

## Submissions  

We have created a **Streamlit app** for result submission:  
🔗 [http://react-md-day2.streamlit.app/](http://react-md-day2.streamlit.app/)  

- **Participants can only submit once at the end of the day.**  
- Follow the instructions in the **hackathon workbook** to ensure correct formatting for automated benchmarking.  

## Additional Notes  
- 📌 **Tracks and teams were pre-assigned**—check the **Teams channel** for details.  
- ❓ **Need help?** Instructors are available **during sessions** and can be reached via **Teams**.
