# CDT Winter School – Day 3  

## Overview  
Day 3 focuses on **Model-Based Design of Experiments (MBDOE)**. In addition to model discrimination, participants will work on optimising experimental design by selecting the most informative data points to improve model predictions.  

## Schedule  
1. **Lecture: Model-Based Design of Experiments**  
2. **Hackathon: Optimising Model Selection and Experimental Design**  

## Hackathon  

The hackathon builds on Day 2’s challenge:  
- The **same candidate model terms** are available.  
- **New training data** is provided, but the **true model remains unknown**.  
- Teams can **request new training data** by submitting `initial_conditions` **twice** via private message on Teams. We will return the requested data accordingly.  

- More detailed instructions can be found in the **hackathon workbook**:  
  📄 [`doe_hackathon/doe_hackathon.ipynb`](./doe_hackathon/doe_hackathon.ipynb)  

### **Tracks**  
- **Track 1:** 🛑 Cannot use LLMs and will be provided with a **basic genetic algorithm template**.  
- **Track 2:** Can use LLMs but must develop their own approach.   

## Submissions  

We have created a **Streamlit app** for result submission:  
🔗 [http://react-doe-day3.streamlit.app/](http://react-doe-day3.streamlit.app/)  

- **Participants can only submit once at the end of the day.**  
- They must submit the **final mask and parameters** they identified.  
- Benchmarking will be based on this **final submission**.  

## Additional Notes  
- 📌 **Tracks and teams were pre-assigned**—check the **Teams channel** for details.  
- ❓ **Need help?** Instructors are available **during sessions** and can be reached via **Teams**.  
- 💡 **Use your training data wisely—experimental design is key to finding the best model!**
